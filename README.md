# Pinball-Tutorial
 
## Part 1 ##
*Scenes and Scripts*
I set up the scenes and scripts for the game, working through the tutorial online as I went. I had made billboards to track the games played and the score of the game, as well as balls played. Sadly, these billboards were not implemented and tracked no such data. On the intro scene, I had an input field for the player name, which was meant to be tracked and referenced in the gameplay, but I hadn't enough time to put it into practice. 

## Part 2 ##
*Flippers and Tricks*
Working on flippers was difficult, but I managed to get them working up and down. With identical coding, except in reverse on speeds and heights for flipping, I expected both to act the same. Unfortunately, my left flipper is bugged and flips without player input.

## Part 3 ## 
*Tutorial Finishing and Scene Building*
Finishing off the bumpers, floating areas, and graphical efxs, I moved on with the tutorial. I added the scenes all to the build, getting a few errors which had no impact on scene transitions and gameplay, so I left it as is. 


## Part 4 ##
*Uploading*
I uploaded every file I could in the hopes that the program would run from a download on another computer. Certain Folders with too many Files were not able to be uploaded wholly without simply uploading their contents file by file. I hope the Assets folder made it in and that the game is playable this time.
